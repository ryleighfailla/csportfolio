About Me and Self-Assessment
My name is Ryleigh Failla and I am an aspiring data science professional with interest in exploratory data analysis, machine learning and data mining. I have been passionate about technology and computer science from a young age, and one of my fondest childhood memories was teaching myself basic HTML and C++ at 10 years old. I have proficiency in programming languages such as Python, SQL, C++ and Java.

Throughout my journey going back to school I realized that I have a strong preference for applied statistics and analysis. Outside of coursework I currently work in a field that requires a great amount of analysis and creative foresight and I have found that I have been able to refine these skills over the years. I hope to pursue a career that challenges me and forces me to become more innovative.
